Module 1: Introduction to OOP

- Understanding the fundamentals of OOP and its benefits in software development.
- Key OOP concepts: classes, objects, inheritance, polymorphism, and encapsulation.
- Overview of the Java programming language and its support for OOP.

Tasks:
 - Create a simple Java program that demonstrates the concept of classes and objects:
Program Description: Create a program that models a library system. Design a class called "Book" with attributes like title, author, and ISBN. Create an object
of the "Book" class and demonstrate how to set and retrieve the book details using the object.

 - Implement a class hierarchy with inheritance to model a real-world scenario (e.g., animals, vehicles):
Program Description: Design a class hierarchy to represent different types of vehicles. Start with a base class called "Vehicle" and create subclasses 
like "Car," "Motorcycle," and "Truck." Each subclass should inherit common attributes and behaviors from the base class while having their own unique properties and methods.

 - Explore the concept of encapsulation by creating classes with private attributes and public accessor methods:
Program Description: Develop a program that simulates a shopping cart. Create a class called "CartItem" with private attributes such as product name, 
price, and quantity. Implement public accessor methods (getters and setters) to access and modify the attributes. Demonstrate how to create objects of the "CartItem" 
class and interact with them using the accessor methods.


Module 2: Classes and Objects

- Creating classes and objects in Java.
- Defining attributes and methods within classes.
- Understanding constructors and their role in object initialization.
- Encapsulation and access modifiers for data hiding.

Tasks:
- Design and implement a class that represents a bank account with attributes such as account number, balance, and owner's name. Include methods for depositing and withdrawing funds.
- Create a class hierarchy for different shapes (e.g., circle, rectangle, triangle) and implement methods for calculating their areas and perimeters.
- Explore different access modifiers (public, private, protected) by designing classes with various visibility levels for attributes and methods.


Module 3: Inheritance and Polymorphism

- Understanding inheritance and its significance in OOP.
- Implementing inheritance hierarchies and superclass-subclass relationships.
- Polymorphism and method overriding.
- Abstract classes and interfaces for defining common behaviors.

Tasks:
- Create a superclass called "Vehicle" and subclasses such as "Car," "Motorcycle," and "Truck." Implement specific behavior and attributes in each subclass while utilizing inheritance.
- Implement an interface called "Drawable" with a method called "draw()" and create multiple classes that implement this interface. Demonstrate polymorphism by invoking the "draw()" method on objects of different classes.
- Design an abstract class called "Animal" with abstract methods and create concrete subclasses such as "Cat," "Dog," and "Bird" that provide implementations for these methods.


Module 4: Encapsulation and Access Control

- Encapsulation principles and their importance in OOP.
- Access modifiers (public, private, protected) and their impact on class members.
- Getters and setters for controlled access to object properties.
- Applying encapsulation to enhance code maintainability and security.

Tasks:
- Create a class to represent a student with private attributes such as name, age, and grade. Implement public methods to set and get these attributes while following encapsulation principles.
- Design a class representing a bank account and use appropriate access modifiers to control access to the account balance. Implement public methods for depositing and withdrawing funds, ensuring encapsulation is maintained.
- Refactor existing code that violates encapsulation principles by directly accessing private attributes. Modify the code to use getter and setter methods instead.


Module 5: Exception Handling

- Understanding exceptions and error handling in Java.
- Exception handling with try-catch blocks.
- Handling multiple exceptions and creating custom exceptions.
- Proper exception handling and graceful error recovery.

Tasks:
- Write a program that reads input from the user and handles potential exceptions such as NumberFormatException and ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException using try-catch blocks.
- Create a custom exception class called "InsufficientFundsException" and use it to handle situations where a bank account withdrawal exceeds the available balance.
- Modify an existing program to include proper exception handling, ensuring the program gracefully recovers from errors and provides informative error messages.


Module 6: Advanced OOP Concepts

- Polymorphism through interfaces and abstract classes.
- Composition and aggregation to build complex object relationships.
- Method overloading and overriding for flexible behavior customization.
- Singleton and factory design patterns.

Tasks:
- Implement an interface called "Playable" with methods like "play()" and "stop()." Create multiple classes that implement this interface, such as "AudioPlayer" and "VideoPlayer," and demonstrate polymorphism.
- Design a class representing a university that consists of departments. Use composition to model the relationship between the university and its departments.
- Apply method overloading and overriding concepts to create a class hierarchy for mathematical operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.


Module 7: Designing Object-Oriented Applications

- Design principles and best practices for building modular and maintainable applications.
- Separation of concerns and the SOLID principles.
- Design patterns and their application in Java development.
- Testing and debugging techniques for OOP applications.

Tasks:
- Refactor an existing codebase to adhere to the SOLID principles, such as separating concerns, applying single responsibility, and using dependency inversion.
- Implement a design pattern, such as the Observer pattern, in a real-world scenario to demonstrate its benefits in modularity and maintainability.
- Develop a testing strategy for a complex OOP application, including unit tests and integration tests. Use debugging techniques to identify and resolve issues in the code.
