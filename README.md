This is a Java learning project. The idea of this project is to learn the basics of Java using only chatGPT and Google.

# Using of chatGPT
I leverage ChatGPT to assist me in writing descriptions for my practice tasks, which I undertake. Additionally, I utilize it to gather the necessary topics I need to learn to establish a solid foundation in Java programming. You can access the comprehensive list of these topics in the "Java topics.txt" file. Furthermore, as I progress through my learning journey, I organize all the tasks, their corresponding descriptions, and their solutions in separate folders, ensuring a structured approach to my work.

# Using of Google
The google I use to get understanding of syntax and OOP principles. The OOP I`m getting from <a href="Oracle.com">oracle</a> and the most of syntax I get from <a href="w3schools.com">W3schools</a> and <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/">StackoverFlow</a>

# Coursera 
For OOP learning I`ve got a course on coursera that is called <a href=https://www.coursera.org/programs/natsional-nii-univiersitiet-zaporiz-ka-politiekhnika-learning-program-9mv7c/learn/object-oriented-programming-with-java>Introduction to Object-Oriented Programming with Java</a>. All theory and labaratory works have been gotten from there. 

# Time boundaries
Here I`ll write how much time each topic took me to learn with exact dates.
