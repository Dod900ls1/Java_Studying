This is a Java learning project. The idea of this project is to learn the basics (or more) of Java using only chatGPT and Google.

# Using of chatGPT
I use chatGPT only for creating main topics which I need to accomplish in order to learn Java. 
The main file with topics called "Java arrays course.txt", there are everything I would learn in the nearest future.

# Using of Google
The google I use to get understanding of syntax and OOP principles. The OOP I`m getting from <a href="Oracle.com">oracle</a> and the most of syntax I get from <a href="w3schools.com">W3schools</a> and <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/">StackoverFlow</a>

# Time boundaries
Here I`ll write how much time each topic took me to learn with exact dates.
