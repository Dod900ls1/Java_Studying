Array Manipulation:

Create an array of integers and populate it with some values.
Write a program to find the sum, average, maximum, and minimum values in the array.
Implement sorting algorithms (e.g., bubble sort, selection sort) to sort the array in ascending or descending order.
Write a program to reverse the elements in the array.

ArrayList Operations:
Create an ArrayList of strings and add some elements to it.
Remove specific elements from the ArrayList using different methods (e.g., remove(), removeAll()).
Use the ArrayList methods to search for an element, check if an element exists, and retrieve elements by index.
Iterate over the ArrayList using a for-each loop and perform some action on each element.

LinkedList Usage:
Create a LinkedList of integers and add elements to it.
Insert an element at the beginning, middle, and end of the LinkedList.
Remove elements from the LinkedList using different methods (e.g., removeFirst(), removeLast(), remove(index)).
Implement a stack or queue using LinkedList and perform operations such as push, pop, enqueue, and dequeue.

Working with 2D Arrays:
Declare and initialize a 2D array of integers or characters.
Write a program to find the sum of rows, columns, or diagonals in the 2D array.
Perform matrix operations like addition, subtraction, and multiplication.
Implement a tic-tac-toe game using a 2D array to represent the board and check for a win condition.

Collections Framework:
Use HashSet or TreeSet to store a collection of unique elements and perform set operations like union, intersection, and difference.
Use HashMap or TreeMap to store key-value pairs and perform operations like adding elements, retrieving values, and iterating over entries.
Explore the Collections class methods (e.g., sort, reverse) to manipulate lists and arrays.
Convert between different collection types (e.g., ArrayList to HashSet) using methods from the Collections class.
